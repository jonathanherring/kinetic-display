# Shimmer Interactive Display

When I was first diving into programming, I was excited to learn that coding could be used to make art. 
I was recently inspired to make something quite out of the ordinary. The inspiration came from a building in Denver
called 'The Spire'. 


The Spire has thousands of metal plates that move in the wind, creating a spectacular display. I wondered how I could make a
